Vision lab3 rough work
________________________________________________

ok so I've tried surf with the decent transformed image and the bookviews, I get the feeling that if I can isolate the page from the background then there is a good chance I can classify the image

so we have blue dots, now lets try doing a hough for a circle

using blur and otsu thresholding to get a binary image of the blue dots, adaptive thresholding included a lot of outside parts

now we need to connect the dots

I could find all the clusters of white in the image and mark them as dots. Then I could get the slopes between each of them and if pairings matched then that is a line. Start at the top and get the top points

lets try hough one more time

working pretty well
