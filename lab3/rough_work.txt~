Vision lab3 rough work
________________________________________________

ok so I've tried surf with the decent transformed image and the bookviews, I get the feeling that if I can isolate the page from the background then there is a good chance I can classify the image

so we have blue dots, now lets try doing a hough for a circle

using blur and otsu thresholding to get a binary image of the blue dots, adaptive thresholding included a lot of outside parts

now we need to connect the dots

I could find all the clusters of white in the image and mark them as dots. Then I could get the slopes between each of them and if pairings matched then that is a line. Start at the top and get the top points

lets try hough one more time

working pretty well, a few really large cluster mess it up though, going to try an remove them, esp image 35, 36 +

cluster deletion works
#todo get points of intersection, bottom points are bottomright, rightmost are topright et

erode all points down to 1 pixel

min bottom length: 350
min top length: 460

get distance between points

min-distance-between = 85

right so doing blur and thresholding on the hough lines is interesting, going to see if we can use non-maxima surpression to get the line thinner
another option might be starting again using edge detection and see how good we can get it

OOOOH maybe use a corner detector on our output - nope

could look for any 3 image points which are a certain proportion or width from each other
